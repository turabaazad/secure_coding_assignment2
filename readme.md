# Reflection

Do these results match what you found in your previous peer review? Why or why not?

Do you think they caught all the vulnerabilities present in the code? Why or why not?

They were not being able to catch all the vulnerabilities present in the code because they were not being able to detact the insecure api gateway , also the validation requires in the function even the plain text hardcoded credentials.
They can only detatct vulnerabilities relates with the SQL injection

Why is using multiple code scanners better than using one?

Each of the code scanner have their own specefic criteria to catch the vulnerabilities . using multiple code scanner helps to 
figure different vulnerabilities that might reside in the code each of this code scanner have their own specialtiy so using 
multiple of code scanner might help to find the vulnerabilities better. which makes the code more secure.
